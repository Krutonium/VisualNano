# VisualNano
## A nano-like Editor written in C# using ETO.

I was constantly hitting the wrong keys in GUI text editors, after using nano a LOT. Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to close, etc.

So I did the only logical thing and wrote my own text editor with the default key binding of Nano, at least in the parts implemented so far.

So far I've tested it on Windows and Linux, but it should work fine on MacOS as well.
